AutoLINK is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project designed to automate website infrastructure, security pipelines, and business/marketing operations through an integrated CI/CD workflow.

The platform incorporates AI-driven automation for building, deploying, and managing a modern web application with scalability, security, and operational efficiency in mind. It is built with professional development methodologies, ensuring that the system is modular, maintainable, and ready for production.

📌 Purpose
The primary goal of AutoLINK is to:

Automate business workflows such as website content updates, marketing campaign scheduling, and analytics-based adjustments.

Integrate security pipelines directly into the CI/CD process for continuous monitoring and compliance enforcement.

Provide a flexible, scalable infrastructure that supports future feature expansion and integrates with hosting services like Sevalla.

Enable AI-assisted development for intelligent deployment management, automated testing, and anomaly detection.
