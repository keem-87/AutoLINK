# AutoLINK

AutoLINK is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project designed to automate website infrastructure, security pipelines, and business/marketing operations through an integrated CI/CD workflow. The platform incorporates AI-driven automation for building, deploying, and managing a modern web application with scalability, security, and operational efficiency in mind. It is built with professional development methodologies, ensuring that the system is modular, maintainable, and ready for production.

## 📌 Purpose

The primary goal of AutoLINK is to:

- Automate business workflows such as website content updates, marketing campaign scheduling, and analytics-based adjustments.
- Integrate security pipelines directly into the CI/CD process for continuous monitoring and compliance enforcement.
- Provide a flexible, scalable infrastructure that supports future feature expansion and integrates with hosting services like Sevalla.
- Enable AI-assisted development for intelligent deployment management, automated testing, and anomaly detection.

## 🚀 Features

**MERN Stack Architecture**

- **MongoDB** for scalable database storage.
- **Express.js** for backend API services.
- **React** for dynamic, responsive UI.
- **Node.js** for server-side logic and integration.

**AI-Augmented CI/CD**

- Automated builds and deployments via GitHub Actions and Sevalla.
- Security-as-Code with continuous vulnerability scanning.
- Real-time deployment health checks.

**Scalability and Performance**

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keem-87/AutoLINK.git
cd AutoLINK
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```

3. **Set environment variables**  
Create a `.env` file in the root directories for both `client` and `server`:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

4. **Run in development**

```bash
# Run client
cd client && npm start

# Run server
cd server && npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Deployment

- The project is configured for Sevalla hosting.
- GitHub Actions automatically triggers a build & deploy when commits are pushed to `main`.
- To redeploy manually:
  1. Log in to [Sevalla Dashboard](https://app.sevalla.com).
  2. Select your project.
  3. Click **Deploy Now**.

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Add AI-based deployment optimization.
